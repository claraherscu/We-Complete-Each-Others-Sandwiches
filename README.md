# We-Complete-Each-Others-Sandwiches

The project was to create an interface where one can enter a few ingredients they use as a recipe, and get in return a few other good ingredients that go well together with the user's ingredients.
We used association rule mining techniques to find relations between ingredients, from recipes that we scraped from two websites.

The project has three folders:
1. Association Rule Mining has the code that we ran on the scraped recipes to create the association rules that were used as a static DB for the UI
2. Crawler has the code that we used to scrape the recipes.
3. UI has the code for the UI of the project.

The report for our course is attached in the main directory, and the actual project can be seen in the following link:
